    `Executes a given bash command in a persistent shell session, ensuring proper handling and security measures.

Before executing the command, please follow these steps:

1. Directory Verification:
   - If the command will create new directories or files, first use the listFiles tool to verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location
   - For example, before running "mkdir foo/bar", first use listFiles to check that "foo" exists and is the intended parent directory

2. Command Execution:
   - After ensuring proper quoting, execute the command.
   - Capture the output of the command.

Usage notes:
- The command argument is required.
- If the output exceeds 30000 characters, output will be truncated before being returned to you.
- When issuing multiple commands, use the ';' or '&&' operator to separate them. DO NOT use newlines (newlines are ok in quoted strings).
- In order to ensure good formatting, ALWAYS pass the multi-line argument via a HEREDOC, a la this example:
<example>
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
   Commit message here.

   )"
</example>

Important:
- NEVER update the git config
- Return the PR URL when you're done, so the user can see it
