Create a single-page economic data analysis dashboard with interactive visualizations. The dashboard should include the following components:

- A clean, modern interface with a responsive grid layout that adapts to different screen sizes.
- A header section with dashboard title, time period selector, and data refresh controls.
- Multiple chart types to visualize different economic indicators:
  * Line charts for time-series data like GDP growth, inflation rates, or stock market indices.
  * Bar charts for comparing economic indicators across different countries or regions.
  * Pie/donut charts for showing composition data like sector contributions to GDP.
  * Heatmaps for correlation analysis between different economic variables.
- Interactive features including tooltips, zoom functionality, and the ability to toggle between different data series.
- Filter controls allowing users to select specific time periods, regions, or economic sectors.
- A summary statistics panel showing key metrics and their recent changes.
- Data tables that complement the visualizations with precise figures.
- Export functionality for charts and data in various formats (PNG, CSV, etc.).
- Responsive design that works well on desktop and tablet devices.

Use modern JavaScript libraries like Chart.js, D3.js, or ECharts for creating the visualizations. Consider implementing a dark/light theme toggle for better user experience. The dashboard should load sample economic data by default but could be designed to connect to real economic data APIs.
