Create a low-poly forest scene in THREE.js featuring a lake next to a cave. Use raw primitives to build all models. Do not use any external models or textures.

The scene should be of a good looking, with aesthetically pleasing colors and lighting. Use a low-poly style for all models, including trees, rocks, and the cave entrance. The lake should have a reflective surface, and the cave should be dark and mysterious.

Implement WASD movement controls and mouse look functionality for navigation in the scene.
