Create a modern, minimalist newsletter signup form for a fictional brand.

The signup form should include the following elements:

- A centered card with subtle shadow and rounded corners.
- A white card on a subtle purple gradient backdrop for a clean, modern look.
- A logo or brand mark displayed at the top.
- A welcoming headline, e.g., "Subscribe to My Newsletter," and a brief subheading explaining the value proposition.
- Social sign-up options with recognizable icons.
- An email input field and a prominent call-to-action button (e.g., purple or indigo).
- Additional links below the form for terms, privacy, or help.
A footer with trust indicators, such as "We respect your privacy."
