Create a visually stunning immersive 3D animation where the viewer is inside a holographic sphere in react.

- The sphere should envelop the viewer, creating an immersive 360Â° experience with a sleek, futuristic design.
- The sphere's inner surface should feature an iridescent, holographic pattern with shifting, brightly colored geometric shapes (e.g., cubes, pyramids, spheres, rings) that create a mesmerizing crystalline effect. Each shape type should have a distinct and vibrant color.
- Multiple floating, metallic shapes (rings, cubes, etc.) should be positioned directly in front of the viewer, each rotating and moving in intricate patterns, serving as central focal points. These shapes should also have distinct, vibrant colors.
- The shapes should emit energy pulses or have particle trails in their respective colors, interacting with the surrounding environment.
- Incorporate dynamic particle effects flowing across the sphere's surface (e.g., glowing energy waves, light trails, or pulsating geometric patterns), with colors corresponding to the nearby shapes.
- Implement impressive lighting effects that cast colorful refractions and caustics through the crystalline structure, reflecting the colors of the shapes.
- Add subtle motion to the entire environment, creating a sensation of floating within this magical space.
- The animation should loop seamlessly for continuous immersion.
- Consider adding interactive elements that respond to mouse movement or clicks.
- Use a suitable JavaScript library for 3D rendering in the browser (e.g., Three.js, Babylon.js) to achieve high-quality visuals and smooth performance.
