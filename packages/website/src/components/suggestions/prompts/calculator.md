Create an interactive calculator application with a factorial function. The calculator should include the following features:

- A clean, modern user interface with a display area at the top.
- A grid of number buttons (0-9) for input.
- Basic operation buttons (+, -, ร, รท).
- A factorial button (n!) that calculates the factorial of the current number.
- A clear button (C) to reset the calculator.
- An equals button (=) to perform calculations.
- Visual feedback when buttons are pressed.
- Error handling for invalid operations (like factorial of negative numbers).
- Responsive design that works well on different screen sizes.

The factorial function should be able to calculate factorials up to at least 12! (479,001,600). For larger numbers, consider displaying the result in scientific notation or showing an overflow message.
